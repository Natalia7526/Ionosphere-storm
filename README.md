Ionosphere storms
This is an app I created as part of my master's thesis. I created an independent platform to warn about the occurrence of ionospheric storms in Wroclaw and Lower Silesia in general. Calculations are performed on the basis of files received from WROC station, and all visualizations were made using Plotly and Leaflet libraries.
